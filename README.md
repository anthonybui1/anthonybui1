### Hello there :wave:

My name is **Anthony**, I am a fullstack developer currently working out of **Austin, TX**. :metal:

I graduated from the University of Texas with a B.S. in **Biochemistry**. Throughout the years I have been a barista, pharmacy technician, and ophthalmic technician (I love **coffee** and taking care of **eyeballs**). **Powerlifting** is my thing, and I compete in the 66kg weight class.

I love **learning** and **teaching**. I believe that the best way to learn new things is to teach, and that the moment I stop learning new things is the moment I get bored. Fortunately, programming provides an unlimited learning experience! :blush:

#### Technical

Currently invested in the **(P/M)ERN** stack: PostgreSQL/MongoDB, Express, React, Node

I am learning **Typescript**, and eventually want to learn C++ or Rust

#### Contact

If you would like to speak to me, please send an email at **anthony-222@live.com** :heart:
