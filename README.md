### Hello there :wave:

My name is **Anthony**, I am a frontend developer currently working out of **Austin, TX**. :metal:

#### About Me

I graduated from the University of Texas with a B.S. in **Biochemistry**. Throughout the years I have been a barista, pharmacy technician, and ophthalmic technician (I love making **coffee** and taking care of **eyeballs**). **Powerlifting** is my thing, and I compete in the 66kg weight class.

I love **learning** and **teaching**. It is so important to learn new things every day, and I believe that the best way to learn new things is to teach. Fortunately, programming provides an unlimited learning experience! :blush:

#### Technologies

Currently invested in the **(P/M)ERN** stack: PostgreSQL/MongoDB, Express, React, Node.

I am learning **TypeScript**, and eventually want to learn C++ or Rust.
