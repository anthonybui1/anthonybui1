## About Me
My name is **Anthony**, and I am a web developer working out of beautiful Austin, TX. :metal:

I am a tech transplant, having been a barista, pharmacy and ophthalmic technician. 
Outside of coding I enjoy powerlifting in the 66kg weight class. I love learning and teaching. 
I believe it is so important to try and learn new things every day, and that the best way 
to learn new things is to teach.
