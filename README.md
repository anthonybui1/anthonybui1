### Hello there :wave:

My name is **Anthony**, I am a web developer currently working out of **Austin, TX**. :metal:

#### About Me

I am a tech transplant, carrying a diverse background as a barista, pharmacy technician, and
ophthalmic technician. I also powerlift in the 66kg weight class.

every day, and that the best way to learn new things is to teach. Fortunately for me, programming 
provides an unlimited learning experience! :blush:
