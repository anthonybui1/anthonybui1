## Hello there :wave:

My name is **Anthony**, I am a web developer working out of beautiful **Austin, TX**. :metal:

### About Me

I am a tech transplant, having been a barista, pharmacy technician, and
ophthalmic technician. Outside of coding I enjoy powerlifting in the 66kg weight class. 

I love **learning** and **teaching**. I believe that it is so important to try and learn new things 
every day, and that the best way to learn new things is to teach. Fortunately for me, programming 
provides an unlimited learning experience! :blush:
